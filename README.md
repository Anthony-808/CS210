# CS210

1) Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.

   This project displays counts and displays the frequency of words in a text file. It displays the frequency data in a number of forms which the user chooses. The available forms are: the instances of a single word, a list of all words and their frequency, a         histogram of all words and their frequency. 

2) What did you do particularly well?

   I think I did well with naming my variables and functions. I beleive I made it so a person reading the code could tell what a variables or functions purpose is without reading their definitions or comments.

3) Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?

   I would like to find a better way to get user input. For example, a radio button that the end user could select wouldn't need any input validation and would feel less outdated.
   
4) Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
   
   I found reading data from the text file the most challenging to write. It took me a while to get the program to sucessfully open the file. After googling the error I found that I had the file in the wrong folder. This solution didn't prompt to add any              resources to my support network, google has always been my go-to.
  
5) What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?

   Oddly enough, the skill that I beleive I developed the most from this course was just working. I've had a bad habit of taking a break between planning a solution, writing a solution, doing research, etc. This normally leads me to being spending more time not       working than working. With this project as soon as I had a cocept I was able to immediatley start writing the code out.
   
6) How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?

   I did this first and foremost by making the program modular. Every task was made into a function. Some of which used arguements which allowed different elements (file names, display widths, etc.) to be added on or changed in the future without having to change     their code. I also made an effort to choose descreptive function and variable names.
