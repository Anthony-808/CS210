# CS210

1) Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.

This project displays counts and displays the frequency of words in a text file. It displays the frequency data in a number of forms which the user chooses. The available forms are: the instances of a single word, a list of all words and their frequency, a histogram of all words and their frequency. 

2) What did you do particularly well?

I think I did well with naming my variables and functions. I beleive I made it so a person reading the code could tell what a variables or functions purpose is without reading their definitions or comments.
